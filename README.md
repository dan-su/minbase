# Minbase

Minbase is an unopinionated minimal base on which to build opinionated [Secure Scuttlebutt](http://scuttlebot.io) clients. 

Minbase is a fork of [Patchbay@6.1.3](https://github.com/ssbc/patchbay/commit/e3a918ef0b3864578f624ca14e12fe1cf0079b3a), which was originally written by Dominic Tarr. In the beginning I wanted to find out just how minimal Patchbay could be, with the idea that 'minbay' would get merged into Master as a depject configuration, however that never happened so now it's a fork as Patchbay@7 and Minbase are now barely resemble each other. Minbase shares a lot of the original Patchbay@6 code, with minimal modifications.
